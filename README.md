# Intro to using git on the command line.

What we're going to do.
- initialize git
- make a some commits and analyze process
- push up our changes
- create branch (unit of change that people can review)
- create a pull request.
- merge it.
- get our local up to date.

If we have time:
- we can talk forks (not eating)
    - general workflow.
